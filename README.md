# Rails::SessionCookie

Fast, loosely coupled requests specs for a cookie-authenticated application.

## Why

Probably, you might have seen a lot code like this:

```ruby
# config/initializers/session_store.rb
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store

# authenticating method (maybe Devise or whatever)
session[:current_user_id] = current_user.id

# somewhere in helper for request specs
def login(current_user)
  post '/login', auth_data(current_user)
end

# now every request spec is calling login request
RSpec.describe 'User interface', type: :request do
  let(:user) { create :user }

  before do
    login(user)
  end

  it 'shows private data' do
    get '/dashboard'
  end
end
```

In a usual user-driven application this tightly couples *all* request specs, which require authentication, to the login process.
If it fails - everything fails. If it's not blazing fast - it slows the whole suite down.

One may move to token-based authentication, especially when having API. That's reasonable and nice.
But HTTP is stateless, really we don't need to do several requests, we can think about a session cookie
as a token passed in a special header!

You can easily pass headers in tests, the only hard thing is getting the cookie value.
Rails may change how a state is serialized into the session cookie. It can be encrypted or not, marshalled
(an old story for rails-3 legacy) or JSONed. Long story short: only rails knows how to generate cookie from data.

This gem replaces your usual process of getting session cookie with the simplest rack app utilizing
2 rails middlewares. Rails is modular, that's cool :)

## Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'rails-session_cookie', group: :test
```

## Usage in requests specs

```ruby
# spec_helper.rb
require 'rails/session_cookie'

def login(current_user)
  # depending on Rails version and session configuration this looks like "cookie_store_key=data--digest; path=/; HttpOnly"
  raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::App.new(current_user_id: current_user.id).session_cookie

  # note, it's raw, not `<<`
  cookies.merge(raw_session_cookie)
end

# ...everything else the same
```

Now you can cache `raw_session_cookie` globally or per-thread depending on `current_user_id` to get things even faster!

You can also use the `raw_session_cookie` directly like this:

```
get "/", {}, { "HTTP_COOKIE" => raw_session_cookie }
```

Strictly speaking, you may cache `Set-Cookie` response header from `/login` URL to achieve same speed (but not coupling ;)
However, never saw this in practice, and consider caching of requests in before-phase bad. YMMV.

## Advanced usage

If you need more sophisticated logic:

```ruby
auth_app = proc { |env|
  # do your magic
  env[Rails::SessionCookie::RACK_SESSION].merge!(context)
  [200, {}, []]
}
raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::App.new(auth_app).session_cookie
```

Of course, you can just make use (and reuse!) of as many procs as you wish.

This effectively achieves the effect as [this PR#18230](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18230/files), which allows session mutation
in a less invasive way in regard to Rails itself ;)

## Warden / Devise

Getting session cookie is dead-simple, just get the cookie this way:

```ruby
raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::WardenApp.new(user).session_cookie
```

## Feature tests using Capybara

Get the cookie as described above according to your setup, and assign this way:

```ruby
Capybara.current_session.driver.browser.set_cookie raw_session_cookie
```

*TODO:* Only tested with `:rack_test` driver!

## Benchmarks

*NOTE:* Sometimes devise's `sign_in` is still faster than `SessionCookie` (a little though),
because Warden uses an [ugly hack, in my opinion,](https://github.com/hassox/warden/blob/master/lib/warden/test/helpers.rb#L18L23)
to support test-mode authentication.

But, still, in average performance of this gem is not worse *if used with user_id->cookie caching*
Besides, authentication becomes as transparent as possible and should increase readability
if you understand HTTP session cookies principles.

```sh
$ appraisal rails-5.1-warden rspec -t performance spec/benchmarks/feature_spec.rb

Speed using capybara in feature test
  correctness of
    SessionCookie
      is correct
    Devise Helpers
      are correct
  against Devise::Test::Helpers
    is obviously slower separately
    is not slower than devise helpers if using cache and executing multiple specs in a suite

session cookie
                        686.868  (± 4.7%) i/s -      3.430k in   5.005542s

Comparison:
devise sign_in           :      700.6 i/s
session cookie           :      686.9 i/s - same-ish: difference falls within error
session cookie (no cache):      611.4 i/s - 1.15x  slower

```

But when it comes with comparison to a simple custom authentication (see `spec/support/rails_app.rb`),
this gem is several times faster! (custom action checks password, hits database, request touches the whole rails middleware stack)

```sh
$ appraisal rails-5.1-warden rspec -t performance spec/benchmarks/request_spec.rb

Speed using custom sign-in in request test
  correctness of
    SessionCookie
      is correct
    usual session controller
      is correct
  against custom sign in route
    is faster separately without cache
