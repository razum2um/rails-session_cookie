# Rails::SessionCookie

Fast, loosely coupled requests specs for a cookie-authenticated application.

## Why

Probably, you might have seen a lot code like this:

```ruby
# config/initializers/session_store.rb
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store

# authentificaing method (maybe Devise or whatever)
session[:current_user_id] = current_user.id

# somewhere in helper for request specs
def login(current_user)
  post '/login', auth_data(current_user)
end

# now every request spec is calling login request
RSpec.describe 'User inferface', type: :request do
  let(:user) { create :user }

  before do
    login(user)
  end

  it 'shows private data' do
    get '/dashboard'
  end
end
```

In a usual user-driven application this tightly couples *all* request specs, which require authentication, to the login process.
If it fails - everything fails. If it's not blazingly fast - it slows the whole suite down.

One may move to token-based authentification, especially when having API. That's reasonable and nice.
But we can think about a session cookie as a token passed in a special header!

This gem replaces your usual process with the simplest 2 rails middleware pass.
Rails is modular, that's cool :)

## Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'rails-session_cookie', group: :test
```

## Usage in requests specs

```ruby
# spec_helper.rb
require 'rails/session_cookie'

def login(current_user)
  # depending on Rails version and session configuration this looks like "cookie_store_key=data--digest; path=/; HttpOnly"
  raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::App.new(current_user_id: current_user.id).session_cookie

  # note, it's raw, not `<<`
  cookies.merge(raw_session_cookie)
end

# ...everything else the same
```

Now you can cache `raw_session_cookie` globally or per-thread depending on `current_user_id` to get things even faster!

You can also use the `raw_session_cookie` directly like this:

```
get "/", {}, { "HTTP_COOKIE" => raw_session_cookie }
```

Strictly speaking, you may cache `Set-Cookie` response header from `/login` URL to achieve same speed (but not coupling ;)
However, never saw this in practice, and consider caching of requests in before-phase bad. YMMV.

## Advanced usage

If you need more sophisticated logic:

```ruby
  auth_app = proc { |env|
    # do your magic
    env[Rails::SessionCookie::RACK_SESSION].merge!(context)
    [200, {}, []]
  }
  raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::App.new(auth_app).session_cookie
end
```

Of course, you can just make use (and reuse!) of as many procs as you wish.

This effectively achieves the effect as [this PR#18230](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/18230/files), which allows session mutation
in a less invasive way in regard to Rails itself ;)

## Warden / Devise

Getting session cookie is dead-simple, just get the cookie this way:

```ruby
raw_session_cookie = Rails::SessionCookie::WardenApp.new(user).session_cookie
```

*NOTE:* Warden uses an [ugly hack, in my opinion](https://github.com/hassox/warden/blob/master/lib/warden/test/helpers.rb#L18L23)
to support test-mode authentication.

*NOTE:* This way you no longer need `sign_in(user)` from `Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers` as well.
Authentication is as transparent as possible and should increase readability if you understand HTTP session cookies.

## Feature tests using Capybara

Get the cookie as described above according to your setup, and assign this way:

```ruby
Capybara.current_session.driver.browser.set_cookie raw_session_cookie
```

*TODO:* Only tested with `:rack_test` driver!
